## Decision

The team has chosen to use React Native for the UI framework.

## Consequences

Choosing React Native as the UI framework is consistent with the desire to build a native app. React Native enables the creation of a single codebase that can operate on both iOS and Android, increasing code reuse and accelerating development. 
Developers may need time to learn React Native if not already familiar.
