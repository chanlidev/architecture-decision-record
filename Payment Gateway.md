# Payment Gateway
## Status

Accepted

## Context

To provide clients with secure and convenient transactions, the retail app must integrate with a variety of payment gateways.

## Decision

Stripe will be used as the primary payment gateway.

## Consequences

Stripe provides a secure, developer-friendly solution that supports international transactions. It's a good fit for the retail app's payment processing requirements. 
However, relying on a single payment gateway may limit flexibility compared to integrating multiple gateways.
