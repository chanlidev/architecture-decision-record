# Localization
## Status

Accepted

## Context

To expand its customer base internationally, the app should handle multiple languages and accommodate various cultural preferences. To ensure that the app's content is accessible and relevant to a global audience, the team must implement localization techniques and choose an appropriate translation framework or libraries.

## Decision

The team will use platform-specific localization frameworks.

## Consequences

Platform-specific localization frameworks adapt apps to several languages and cultural preferences. This decision is consistent with the native development methodology, resulting in a seamless and platform-specific localization experience for users.
However, implementing localization may extend development timelines, particularly for languages with complex character sets or varying text lengths.
