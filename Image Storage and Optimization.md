# Image Storage and Optimization
## Status

Accepted

## Context

The app will display product photos of various sizes and resolutions. The team must choose an image storage solution and apply image optimization techniques including caching, lazy loading, and compression. This selection is crucial for providing viewers with a seamless and efficient visual viewing experience.

## Decision

The team will use a mix of platform-specific technologies for picture storage, caching, and optimization.

## Consequences

By utilizing platform-specific technologies for picture storage and optimization, the native app ensures optimal performance and easy integration with each operating system.
Proper implementation of caching, lazy loading, and compression requires careful consideration and may introduce initial complexity.
